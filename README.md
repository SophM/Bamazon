# Bamazon

In this project, I built ...

Bamazon is meant to be run in the terminal, using Node.js. Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment, that allows to execute JavaScript code outside of a browser.

### Getting set up

Several node packages have to be installed for Bamazon to run properly. Follow the steps below to get set up:

1. Using your terminal, navigate to the folder containing bamazonCustomer.js.

2. If you DON'T have a file called "package.json" in your folder, run: `npm init -y` to create this file. If you do have this file, skip this step.

3. Install the node packages, one after the other - the order doesn't matter - by running:
- `npm install inquirer`
- `npm install mysql`
- `npm install cli-color`
- `npm install cli-table`

4. After installing the required packages, type `node bamazonCustomer.js` in your terminal to start using Bamazon!
